</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Towards</span> the middle of last July, the people
of Liverpool were surprised by the advent of
a large band of Greek gypsies, ninety-nine in
number, whom the London train had left
stranded on a vacant space of ground beside the
railway station. Though spoken of as ‘Greek’
gypsies, they were really from all parts of the
Græco-Turkish corner of Europe, and some even
from Smyrna and its neighbourhood. But they
preferred to be regarded as Greeks, and all of
them spoke the modern Greek tongue. They
had come to Liverpool, intending to take an
early steamer to New York; but their progress
was here suddenly arrested; and their stay in
Liverpool proved to be of longer duration than
had been anticipated by themselves or by others.
From their first squatting-ground beside the
station they had early been removed to a
secluded corner at Walton, within the grounds
of the Zoological Gardens. But how long they
must yet remain there, and what was to be done
with them, seemed difficult problems.</p>

<p>It was not the fault of these strange emigrants
that they thus halted on the outward verge of
Europe. They had honestly paid their way
hither from their Mediterranean home, and they
had enough money among them to pay for their
passage across the Atlantic. But at this point
America interfered. Ready as she once was to
welcome all immigrants with open arms, America
has become less hospitable of recent years. She has
excluded the Chinaman, for racial reasons; and
now she is drawing the line at the ‘pauper,’ of
whatever race, because of his poverty. It is not
many years since Longfellow apostrophised <i>Driving
Cloud</i>, ‘chief of the mighty Omawhaws,’ telling
him it was in vain that he and his meagre tribe
‘claimed the soil for their hunting-grounds,’</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">While down-trodden millions</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Starve in the garrets of Europe, and cry from its caverns that they, too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have been created heirs of the earth, and claim its division!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But times are changed. And the European
‘pauper’ finds no resting-place on North American
soil, but is sent back to his old hopeless
existence in the garrets and ‘caverns’ of Europe.
It is only the self-supporting immigrant that
receives a welcome. There is nothing unnatural
in this attitude of the Americans. A young and
ambitious country does not want its ranks to be
recruited from the idle, unenergetic, and criminal
classes of older states; indeed, half the troubles
of America have come, not from the descendants
of the men who founded the Republic, but from
the heterogeneous invaders of the present century.
Thus, the American attitude is intelligible enough.
Nevertheless, the mere fact that the poor are not
permitted to seek a home in that vast country,
forms a grim commentary on the popular conception
of America as the great haven of refuge
for all the victims of Old-world tyrannies.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the appearance of
the gypsy camp at Walton was not at all
suggestive of the ideal emigrant; so that it was
perhaps as well that the present writer conceived
the idea of visiting them without any intention
of advocating their claim to such a title. The
scene, truly, did not suggest any such qualities
as cleanliness, industry, or wealth. Scattered
along two sides of an open grassy triangle stood
the gypsy tents, some fifteen or twenty—small-sized,
mean, and dingy, loosely put together, constructed
of old canvas or sacking, which fell on
either side of a low ridge-pole, and was closed
at one end. In the open space between the two
rows of tents a group of gypsy men were amusing
themselves—some wrestling and fighting playfully;
while the others looked on, talking, laughing,
and smoking. A few female figures were
moving about among the tents; and a host of
children, of all sizes, scampered, toddled, and
tumbled over the grass, as happy as if they had
never breathed a milder air than that of this
chilly English summer day.</p>

<p>One glance at the swarthy faces of these people
was enough to convince one that their claim to be
called ‘gypsies’ did not rest upon the mere fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">{578}</span>
that they were nomads by habit and tinkers by
trade, but that they were the little-mixed representatives
of a distinct racial type. A closer
examination did reveal the presence of an infusion
of white blood among a few of them; but nearly
all were the darkest of all dark-skinned Europeans.
In no degree whatever did their tawny
complexion result from long exposure to wind
and sun; for, when one glanced at the skin
which their half-open shirts disclosed, or at the
bodies of the ill-clad little creatures everywhere
running about, one saw the same uniform dusky
hue. The hair of all was jet black; but the
colour of their eyes seemed to be invariably of a
deep hazel shade, rather than the opaque black
that may be seen in the eyes of many people of
a fairer skin.</p>

<p>No sooner were their visitors descried, than
several young children, and one girl of about
seventeen, swooped down on them with pleading
cries for money. Strongly resembling the children
of our itinerant Italians in their dress and
appearance, they were also like them in their
appealing tones and in the very words they used.
‘Grazia, grazia, deh mi pena [penny], ma dona!’
were the words they reiterated in various combinations,
as they held out their dirty little
hands beseechingly for the expected ‘pena.’
Whether they had become familiar with this
Italian patois during their temporary residence
in Italy, or whether—as is likelier—they had been
always accustomed to it in their homes among
the Ionian Islands, it was clearly the favourite
form of speech among the younger children.
But that they also understood modern Greek
became speedily clear, although they were far
from appreciating the uses to which that language
was put. For on this occasion the writer was
accompanied by a Greek gentleman, representing
an eminent merchant of Liverpool who had
greatly exerted himself on behalf of his otherwise
friendless countrymen; and by his instructions,
all attempts at begging were sternly suppressed,
not only because the thing itself was objectionable,
but also because he foresaw that, if indulged
in, it would further complicate the position of
the gypsies, and counteract his efforts to arouse
the sympathy of the American authorities.
Accordingly, by a few rapid sentences in Greek,
the suppliants were effectually repressed.</p>

<p>As soon as the leading men of the band who
were then present—the chief himself had gone
into town with two of his followers—understood
that one of their visitors was a fellow-countryman,
representing their patron, they thronged
around him with a hundred questions, gesticulating
violently the while; and the burden of
their complaint was: ‘How long must we remain
here?’ ‘Why should we be detained when our
journey is half over?’ ‘Why will the Americans
not let us come?’ Their case was really a hard
one. Three hundred napoleons had they spent
on their journey from Greece—on the clear
understanding that they were to obtain a passage
across the Atlantic from Liverpool, the money
for which they had in their possession. Then
came the word that they would not be allowed
to land; when immediately the steamship companies
unanimously refused to take them as
passengers. Nor was Canada a bit more friendly
than the States; so that only South America
remained open to them. This, indeed, was
where they specially wished to go—among the
Southern Europeans and their fellow-gypsies.
But a voyage to Brazil means a great deal more
money than the short passage to New York.
The other alternative held up to them—to return
to their native country—they indignantly repelled.
They had left it for want of employment, and
in the hopes of making more money in the New
World; for the reasons, in short, which induce
other people to emigrate; and they had no wish
to waste their substance on a fruitless journey
to and from Liverpool.</p>

<p>Although nomadic gypsies, not very clean in
their appearance and ways, it must be remembered
that these people were, like many other gypsies,
honest craftsmen. Some English gypsies who
visited them came away with the impression
that they were extremely well skilled in metal-working;
and the account given by one of their
‘interviewers,’ a Roumanian gentleman, quite
bears this out. ‘Mr —— asked the chief why
the tribe thought of going to America, and was
answered that they wished to make a living.
In Roumania they could “use the lead” [solder],
and they could make and clean pans [the pans
being presumably of copper, since they were
noted for their skill in copper-working]. They
were also builders, and carried bricks and mortar.
They also tilled the soil.... From his
[Mr ——’s] knowledge of their habits in Roumania,
he did not think the Americans need
fear their advent, as they would strive to earn
an honest living.’ To all this favourable testimony
may be added the statement made by the
proprietor of the Gardens, that, so far as he
could judge, they were absolutely free from the
vice of drunkenness, which was more than he
could say of many of the ‘roughs’ who came
to look at them.</p>

<p>The passports which they produced from their
pocket-books were seen to be bi-lingual—French
and Greek in several instances, French and Roumanian,
apparently, in others. One ran in the
name of King Milan I. of Servia. The French
designation given to them was that of <i>chaudronnier</i>
(tinker). Their Christian names, detailed
in their respective passports, were various—such
as Michael (the name of their chief), Constantin,
Stefano, and Janka; among the female names
were Maria and Ghuri (pron. Gew′ri). The
passports, which had been duly <i>visé’d</i> by the
various consuls, frequently included a considerable
number of individuals in each, thus covering
one or more families. As already stated,
these people came from all parts of Greece and
European Turkey—from Corfu on the west, and
Smyrna on the east, and also from the principalities
of Servia, Bulgaria, and Roumania. Many
of them, no doubt, are among the people particularly
treated of in Dr Paspati’s well-known
work on the Turkish Gypsies.</p>

<p>After their first expressions of indignation
and annoyance at their mysterious detention
had passed off, these men fell into a pleasanter
humour, and accepted with gratitude a few cigars
which their visitors offered them. They seemed
great smokers, both men and women, their
favourite pipe being about a foot in length,
with a pendulous, elastic tube. On learning that
the present writer had come all the way from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">{579}</span>
‘Scozia’ (Scotland) to see them, they showed
much gratification, to which their chief spokesman
at once gave expression in modern Greek
through the medium of our interpreter; and,
pointing to the freshly-lit cigar at which he was
now puffing vigorously, he said with emphasis,
‘<i>Bōn’, bōn’</i>;’ in this case employing his Italian
dialect as likely to be the most intelligible form
of speech. This man was quite an accomplished
linguist, and could speak Greek, Russian, Roumanian,
and two or three other dialects of South-eastern
Europe. The curious thing was, that
while he seemed rather proud of his attainments,
he never once included in his list his own
mother-tongue, the speech of the gypsy race.
Neither would he admit that he was a ‘ziganka,’
not for a long time, at anyrate; but subsequently,
both he and his comrades answered to
the name of <i>Roum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the cigar was no longer
<i>bōn’</i>, but <i>lâsho</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The Greek gentleman and the visitor from
Scozia had by this time made a sufficient investigation
of the camp. The general effect of the
people and their surroundings was undoubtedly
disappointing. There was an almost total absence
of colour in their attire, which—among the men,
at least—was very plain, and had little of a distinctive
character about it. One, however, wore
a broad leathern belt studded with brass-headed
nails, which had something about it suggesting
the picturesque; while the fingers of most of
the men and women were adorned with many
rings. The men wore their hair short, and some
had moustaches and beards. There was more
that was characteristic about the women. The
general hue of their attire was ‘sad-coloured,’
like that of the men; but one had a red, white-spotted
kerchief wound round her head, gypsy
fashion; and most of them had necklaces of
coral or beads, and large silver coins disposed
in strings around their neck and shoulders.
Their raven tresses were braided in long plaits,
which hung down on either side. But none of
these gypsy women could be called handsome,
and, indeed, were much inferior to the men in
this respect. Among the children, however, there
were one or two really pretty faces; one, a
little girl of five or six, had quite a refined and
sweet expression, as well as regular delicate
features. In her case, an exception was made
to the stern decree against almsgiving; and it
was amusing to see her shy hesitation as, with
hanging head, and a side-glance at the gypsy
man beside her—who, with many cuffs to right
and left, had repressed all attempts at begging—she
held out a tiny hand for the offered ‘pena,’
while her neat little mouth parted smilingly
over a row of shining ‘ivories.’ The children,
in fact, who numbered more than fifty, constituted
the most attractive feature of the scene;
and queer, impish little creatures they were.
Even where they had no claims to beauty, they
were still inexpressibly droll. Some possessed
very little clothing wherewith to hide their
small brown bodies. One marched gravely about
with nothing on but a dilapidated shirt; while,
in the distance, a nurse about eight years old
was seen to pursue and capture a wholly naked
little savage of half her age. Something in their
serio-comic air and the tumbled-together look of
their garments, frequently reminded one of the
odd little Bohemians in Callot’s etchings.</p>

<p>In one tent lay an old and very dark-skinned,
white-bearded man. Through some accident, he
had lost the use of his legs; but he lay stolidly
on the ground, smoking a cigar, indifferent,
apparently, to the inquisitive looks of a dozen
curious spectators. A baby was lying very still
in a heap of swaddling-clothes beside him—‘dying,’
said some of the onlookers, though the
mother herself pronounced the illness to be
nothing serious.</p>

<p>On leaving the camp, another incident in the
checkered life of the sojourners presented itself.
Two of their young women—girls, rather—had
gone into the streets to do a little ‘shopping,’
and had attempted to enter a butcher’s shop,
with intent to purchase; but from the recesses
of this booth, suddenly evoked by their appearance,
there issued forth what Mr Skimpole
would have described as ‘the absurd figure of
an angry butcher,’ who, with furious mien and
uplifted arm, drove the poor girls back into the
street. Followed by a small crowd of street-children,
the two young Romany maidens strode
along, one with a splendid scowl on her face, as she
flashed her angry glances on the jeering <i>gaújoes</i>.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
But a friend and compatriot was at hand. The
irate butcher, being questioned, explained that he
did not drive them away for any attempted dishonesty,
but because he knew, from the previous
days’ experience, that they had only copper to
offer him for meat that was fairly worth some
silver. To do him justice, the good butcher
began to abate his wrath as soon as he perceived
that there was money to be made after all.
The girls were recalled, and—a perfect mob of
children looking in at door and windows—their
aprons were filled with a goodly store of meat,
with which they departed in happiness, blessing
their kindly benefactor.</p>

<p>This mid-day visit had not been enough for
the gentleman from Scozia, who returned the
same evening to the camp with a small party,
one of the number being a famous ‘word-master’
of Rómanes.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And now it became
apparent that the correctly behaved people
of the forenoon, freed from the check of their
patron’s influence, had dropped the mask, and
stood boldly forth in their true colours. Not
that they were very bad, even then; their only
vice was that of begging. But how to describe
that! From entrance to exit it was incessant,
clamorous, piteous, and beyond all satisfying.
Men, women, children, even babies begged! From
every side came the <i>grazia</i> formula; and the
nearer petitioners would lift and kiss the hem of
one’s garments. Coppers vanished like smoke.
Cigars and cigarettes were eagerly accepted on all
sides, even by mere children. Nay, so free from
shame were the supplicants, that, perceiving
whence one of the ladies drew her store of
cigarettes—thoughtfully laid in for their benefit—one
of the young gypsies quietly thrust his
hand into the folds of the dress and drew out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">{580}</span>
the remaining two or three! There was not
the slightest attempt at violence or furtive theft;
only an incessant, plaintive begging by voice and
manner—of the most artistic order, evolved out
of the practice of many generations. Although
our own gypsies had long ago the reputation of
practising this art, it is now quite dissociated
from them—in this direct form.</p>

<p>Those English gypsies who had visited them
had a good deal to say of their begging propensities.
From one they had demanded tobacco to
an unlimited extent, from others they had asked
for sugar and soap. And while it was amusing
to hear our own gypsies express their righteous
indignation at the ways of their ‘kin beyond
sea,’ it was very interesting to listen to their
remarks upon their common language; for,
although very imperfectly indeed, and only in
occasional-words and phrases, they could understand
each other a little—only a little, however,
so great are the differences of intonation, inflexion,
and vocabulary. Nevertheless, now that
those Greeks had revealed themselves in their
true character as gypsies, it became clearly evident
to their visitors that—unlike their brethren
in Montenegro—they still retained the language
of their race. In the midst of the tumult and
crowd—not only of gypsies but of indiscriminate
<i>gaújoes</i>—it was impossible even for a <i>báro
lávengro</i><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to do more than exchange a few brief
sentences with them. But, in that imperfect
way, it became clear that this was a camp of
true Romané. <i>Roum</i>, or rather <i>Erroum</i> is the
form they give to the more common <i>Rom</i>, in
which peculiarity they resemble the <i>Erroumans</i> of
the Basque countries. Various words were thus
obtained from them, corresponding generally with
those which one finds in Dr Paspati’s collection.</p>

<p>But patience has its limits, and a steady and
persistent demand for <i>largesse</i> cannot be as
steadily complied with; so, with words of farewell
to the older members of the tribe, who
had throughout restrained themselves—and indeed
some of the youthful mendicants, who were void
of shame—the gypsy camp was left to become
an interesting memory.</p>

<p>When these lines were written, the newspapers
told of heavy rains and wet bedraggled tents;
and further, of a proposal made by an inveterate
showman to exhibit the gypsies through the
music-halls, with their ancestral games, dances,
and craftsmanship. Misguided wanderers from
the blue Ægean, is there no better fate before
you than this?</p>

<h3 title="CHAP. I.">IN TWENTY CHAPTERS.—CHAP. I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> shades of evening had commenced to fall;
already the slanting sun shining through the open
window glittered on the array of crystal glasses,
turning the wine within them to a blood-red
hue. The remains of an ample dessert were
scattered about the bare polished table, rich
luscious-looking fruits and juicy pines filling
the air with their fragrance. A pleasant room,
with its panelled walls and quaint curiosities,
with here and there a modern picture framed;
and again other works standing upon easels or
placed against the wainscot. From the Corso
below came the sounds of laughter and gaiety;
while within, the delicate scent of the pines was
overpowered by the odour of tobacco which rose
from the cigarettes of the three men sitting there.
They were all young—artists evidently, and from
the appearance of one of them, he was of a
different nationality from the others. Frederick
Maxwell was an Englishman, with a passion for
art, and no doubt had he been forced to gain a
living by his brush, would have made some stir
in the world; but being born with the traditional
silver spoon in his mouth, his flirtation with the
arts never threatened to become serious. He was
leaving Rome in a few days, and the dessert upon
the table was the remains of a farewell dinner—that
custom dear to every English heart. A
handsome fair-haired man this Englishman, his
clear bright cheek and blue eyes contrasting with
the aquiline features and olive-hued complexions
of his companions. The man with the black
moustache and old velvet painting-jacket, a man
with bohemian stamped on him indelibly, was
Carlo Visci, also an artist, and a genius to boot,
but cursed with that indomitable idleness which
is the bane of so many men of talent. The other
and slighter Italian, he with the melancholy face
and earnest eyes, was Luigi Salvarini, independent
as to means, and possessed, poor fool! with
the idea that he was ordained by Providence for
a second Garibaldi.</p>

<p>There is an infinite sense of rest and comfort,
the desire to sit silent and dream of pleasant
things, that comes with tobacco after dinner,
when the eye can dwell upon the waxlights
glittering on glass and china, and on the artistic
confusion the conclusion of the repast produces.
So the three men sat listlessly, idly there, each
drowsily engaged, and none caring to break
the delicious silence, rendered all the more
pleasing from the gay girlish laughter and the
trip of little feet coming up from the Corso
below. But no true Briton can remain long
silent; and Maxwell, throwing his cigarette out
through the window, rose to his feet, yawning.
‘Heigh-ho! So this pleasant life is come to an
end,’ he exclaimed. ‘Well, I suppose one cannot
be expected to be always playing.’</p>

<p>Carlo Visci roused himself to laugh gently.
‘Did you ever do anything else, my friend?’ he
asked. ‘You play here under sunny skies, in a
velvet painting-jacket; then you leave us to
pursue the same arduous toil in the tall hat of
Albion’s respectability, in the land of fogs and
snows. Ah! yes, it is only a change of venue,
my philosopher.’</p>

<p>‘Not now,’ Salvarini corrected gravely. ‘Remember,
he has vowed by all in his power to
aid the welfare of the League. That vow conscientiously
followed out is undertaking enough
for one man’s lifetime.’</p>

<p>‘Luigi, you are the skeleton at the feast,’ Visci
remonstrated. ‘Cannot you be happy here for
one brief hour without reminding us that we are
bound by chains we cannot sever?’</p>

<p>‘I do not like the mocking tone of your words,’
Salvarini replied. ‘The subject is too earnest for
jesting upon.—Surely, Maxwell, you have not so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">{581}</span>
soon forgotten the solemnity of the oath you took
last night?’</p>

<p>‘I do remember some gibberish I had to repeat,
very much like the conspirators’ chorus at the
Opera,’ Maxwell returned with a careless shrug.
‘It is not bad fun playing at sedition.—But for
goodness’ sake, Luigi, do not keep harping on the
same string, like another Paganini, but without
that wizard’s versatility.’</p>

<p>‘You think it play, do you?’ Salvarini asked
almost scornfully. ‘You will find it stern reality
some day. Your hour may not come yet, it may
not come for years; but if you are ordered to cut
off your right hand, you will have to obey.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, indeed. Thanks, most earnest youth, for
your estimation of my talent for obedience.—Come,
Luigi! do not be so Cassandra-like. If
the worst comes to the worst, I can pitch this
thing into the Tiber.’ He took a gold coin from
his pocket as he spoke, making a gesture as if to
throw it through the open lattice.</p>

<p>Salvarini stood up, terror written in every line
of his face, as he arrested the outstretched arm.
‘For heaven’s sake, Maxwell, what are you thinking
of? Are you mad, or drunk, that you can
dream of such a thing?’</p>

<p>Maxwell laughed as he restored the coin to his
pocket. ‘All right, old fellow. I suppose I must
honour your scruples; though, mind you, I do
not consider myself bound to do anything foolish
even for the League.’</p>

<p>‘You may not think so; indeed, I hope not;
but time will tell.’</p>

<p>Maxwell laughed again, and whistled carelessly,
thinking no more of the little episode. The
League, the coin, everything was forgotten; but
the time did come when he in his hour of need
remembered Luigi’s words, and vividly realised
the meaning of the look on his stern earnest face.</p>

<p>Visci looked on at the incident, totally
unmoved, save by a desire to lead the conversation
into more pleasant channels. ‘When do
you leave, Maxwell?’ he asked. ‘I suppose you
are not going for a few days?’</p>

<p>‘In about a week probably, not sooner. I did
not know I had so many friends in Rome, till I
was going to leave them.’</p>

<p>‘You will not forget your visit to my little
place? Genevieve will never forgive me if I let
you go without saying good-bye.’</p>

<p>‘Forget little Genevieve!’ Maxwell cried. ‘No,
indeed. Whatever my engagements may be, I
shall find time to see her; though, I daresay, the
day will come when she will forget me easily
enough.’</p>

<p>‘I am not so sure of that; she is a warm-hearted
child. I tell you what we will do; and
perhaps Sir Geoffrey and his daughter will join
us. We will go down the day after to-morrow,
and make a day of it.—Of course you will be one,
Luigi?’</p>

<p>It was growing dark now, too dark to see the
rich flush that mounted to the young Italian’s
cheek. He hesitated a moment before he spoke.
‘With pleasure, Carlo. A day at your little
paradise is not to be lightly refused. I will
come gladly.’</p>

<p>‘You make a slight mistake, Visci, when you
speak of Genevieve as a child,’ Maxwell observed
reflectively. ‘She is seventeen—a woman, according
to your Italian reckoning. At anyrate, she
is old enough to know the little blind god, or I
am much mistaken.’</p>

<p>‘I hope not,’ Visci returned gravely. ‘She is
quick and passionate, and somewhat old for her
years, by reason of the seclusion she keeps. But
let the man beware who lightly wins her heart;
it would go hard with him if I crossed his path
again!’</p>

<p>‘There are serpents in every paradise,’ Maxwell
replied sententiously; ‘and let us hope little Gen.
is free from the curiosity of her original ancestress.
But child or not, she has a woman’s heart
worth the winning, in which assertion our silent
friend here will bear me out.’</p>

<p>Luigi Salvarini started from his reverie. ‘You
are right, Maxwell,’ he said. ‘Many a man would
be proud to wear her gage upon his arm. Even
I—— But why ask me? If I was even so disposed
to rest under my own fig-tree, there are ties
which preclude such a blissful thought.’</p>

<p>Maxwell whistled softly, and muttered something
about a man drawing a bow at a venture—the
words audible to Salvarini alone.</p>

<p>‘I am tied, as I told you,’ he continued coldly.
‘I do not know why you have drawn me into
the discussion at all. I have sterner work before
me than dallying by a woman’s side looking into
her eyes’——</p>

<p>‘And not anything like so pleasant, I dare
swear,’ Maxwell interrupted cheerfully. ‘Come,
Luigi; do not be so moody. If I have said anything
in my foolish way to offend you, I am
heartily sorry.’</p>

<p>‘I am to blame, Maxwell, not you. You
wonder why I am so taken up with this League;
if you will listen, I will tell you. The story is
old now; but I will tell you as best I can
remember.’</p>

<p>‘Then, perhaps you will wait till I have found
a seat and lighted my cigarette,’ exclaimed a
voice from the background at this moment. ‘If
Salvarini is going to oblige, I cut in as a
listener.’</p>

<p>At these words, uttered in a thin, slightly
sneering voice, the trio turned round suddenly.
Had it been lighter, they would have seen a
trim, well-built figure, with head well set on
square shoulders, and a perfectly cut, deadly pale
face, lighted with piercing black eyes, and
adorned by a well-waxed, pointed moustache.
From his accents, there must have been something
like a sneer upon his lips. But whatever
he might have been, he seemed to be welcome
enough now as he drew a chair to the open
window.</p>

<p>‘Better late than never,’ Maxwell cried. ‘Help
yourself to wine, Le Gautier; and make all due
apologies for not turning up to dinner.’</p>

<p>‘I will do so,’ the new-comer said languidly.
‘I was detained out of town.—No; you need
not ask if a pair of bright eyes were the lodestars
to my ardent soul, for I shall not tell you;
and in the second place, I have been obtaining
your permit as a Brother of the League. I
offered up myself on the shrine of friendship;
I lost my dinner, <i>voilà tout</i>;’ and saying these
words, he put a narrow slip of parchment in
Maxwell’s hands.</p>

<p>‘I suppose I had better take care of this?’
the Englishman answered carelessly. ‘I got so
exasperated with Salvarini, that I came near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">{582}</span>
pitching the sacred moidore out of the window.
I presume, it would not be wise?’</p>

<p>‘Not if you have any respect for a sound
body,’ Le Gautier returned dryly. ‘I gather
that Luigi has been talking largely about the
sacredness of the mission. Well, he is young
yet, and the gilt of his enthusiasm does not yet
show the nickel beneath, which reminds me.
Did my ears deceive me, or were we going to
hear a story?’</p>

<p>‘It is no story,’ the Italian replied, ‘merely
a little family record, to show you how even
patriots are not exempt from tyranny.—You
remember my brother, Visci? and his wife. He
settled down, after fighting years for his country,
not many miles from here. Living with him
was his wife’s father, an aged man, universally
beloved—a being who had not a single enemy
in the world. Well, time went on, till one day,
without the slightest warning, the old fellow was
arrested for compliance in some so-called plot.
My brother’s wife clung round her father’s neck;
and there, in my brother’s sight, he saw his wife
stricken brutally down by the ruffianly soldiers—dead;
dead, mind—her only crime that little
act of affection—killed by order of the officer
in charge. But revenge followed. Paulo shot
three of the scoundrels dead, and left the officer,
as he thought, dying. Since then, I have never
heard of Paulo.—And now, do you wonder why
I am a Socialist, with my hand against all authority
and order, when it is backed up by such
cowardly, unprovoked oppression as this?’</p>

<p>For a time the listeners remained silent, watching
the twinkling stars as they peeped out one
by one, nothing to be seen now of each but the
glowing tip of his cigarette as the blue smoke
drifted from the casement.</p>

<p>‘You do not think that your brother and
Paulo Lucci, the celebrated brigand we hear
so much of, are the same men?’ Visci asked
at length. ‘People have said so, you understand.’</p>

<p>‘I have heard such a tale,’ Salvarini replied
sardonically. ‘The affair created quite a stir in
the province at the time; but the peasants do
me too much homage in connecting my name
with so famous a character. Our Italian imagination
does not rest at trifles.’</p>

<p>‘Pleasant for the officer who ordered them to
strike down your brother’s wife,’ Le Gautier
drawled, as he emitted a delicate curl of smoke
from his nostrils. ‘Did you ever hear the name
of the fellow?’</p>

<p>‘Curiously enough, his name is the same as
yours, though I cannot be sure, as it is five
years ago now. He was a Frenchman, likewise.’</p>

<p>‘Moral—let all Le Gautiers keep out of Paulo
Lucci’s way,’ Maxwell exclaimed, rising to his
feet. ‘We do not pay you the compliment of
believing you are the same man; but these
brigands are apt to strike first and inquire after.
Of course, this is always presuming Salvarini’s
brother and Paulo Lucci are one.—I am going
as far as the Villa Salvarino. Who says ay to
that proposal?—The ayes have it.’</p>

<p>They rose to their feet with one accord, and
after changing their coats for something more
respectable, trooped down the stairs.</p>

<p>‘You will not forget about Friday?’ Visci
reminded. ‘I shall ask Sir Geoffrey and his
daughter to come. We are going down to my
little place on that day.—Will you make one,
Le Gautier?’</p>

<p>‘A thousand thanks, my dear Visci,’ the
Frenchman exclaimed; ‘but much as I should
like it, the thing is impossible. I am literally
overwhelmed in the most important work.’</p>

<p>A general laugh followed this solemn assertion.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry,’ Visci returned politely. ‘You
have never been there. I do not think you
have ever seen my sister?’</p>

<p>‘Never,’ Le Gautier replied with an inexplicable
smile. ‘It is a pleasure to come.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AN_ATLANTIC_VOYAGEAS_IT_WAS">AN ATLANTIC VOYAGE—AS IT WAS
AND AS IT IS.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Samuel Johnson said, ‘A ship is a prison
with a chance of being drowned,’ he in that
aphorism gave expression to the opinion generally
entertained by landsmen in his day. In fact,
the discomforts, and even privations, which sea-travelling
then involved were such that very few
persons were willing to expose themselves to them,
save when compelled by imperative circumstances
to do so.</p>

<p>When I crossed the Atlantic in 1841, for the
first time, the condition of things had, in the
three-quarters of a century which had elapsed
since Johnson’s time, measurably improved; but
the <i>désagrémens</i> to which passengers were even
then subjected were numerous. No regular steam
communication between Great Britain and the
United States was in existence. The <i>Sirius</i> and
the <i>Great Western</i> had indeed crossed the ocean
in 1838, and the latter vessel had continued her
trips at irregular intervals. But for some little
time subsequently, no other steamer attempted to
follow her example, the Cunard line not having
been established until 1842.</p>

<p>At the period of which I speak, the sailing
packets which ran between London and New
York, and between Liverpool and that port, were
ships of five to six hundred tons burden. The
staterooms—as the little cabins ranged on either
side of the saloon were termed—were below the
sea-level. They were incommodious, dark, and ill
ventilated. In fact, the only light they enjoyed
was that furnished by small pieces of ground glass
inserted in the deck overhead, and from the
fan-lights in the doors opening to the saloon, and
this was so poor, that the occupants of the staterooms
could not even dress themselves without
making use of a lamp. The sole ventilation of
them was that afforded by the removal of the
saloon skylights, which, of course, could only be
done in fine weather. The consequence was that
the closeness of the atmosphere in the staterooms
was at all times most unpleasant; whilst the smell
of the bilge-water was so offensive as to create
nausea, independent of that arising from the
motion of the vessel. In winter, on the other
hand, the cold was frequently severe. There was,
it is true, a stove in the saloon, but the heat from
it scarcely made itself appreciably felt in the side-cabins.</p>

<p>In other matters there was the same absence of
provision for the comfort of the passengers. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">{583}</span>
fresh water required for drinking and cooking
purposes was carried in casks; and when the ship
had a full cargo, many of these were placed on
deck, with the result that their contents were
sometimes impregnated with salt water from the
waves shipped in heavy weather. At all times,
the water was most unpalatable, it being muddy,
and filled with various impurities from the old
worm-eaten barrels in which it was kept. Not
only was the water bad, but the supply occasionally
proved inadequate; and when the voyage
was an unusually long one, the necessity would
arise of placing the passengers upon short allowance.</p>

<p>There was always a cow on board; but there
was no other milk to be had than what she supplied,
no way of preserving it having then been
discovered. Canned fruit and vegetables were
equally unknown. There was commonly a fair
provision of mutton and pork, live sheep and
pigs being carried; but of other fresh meat
and of fish, the stock was generally exhausted by
the time the vessel had been a few days at
sea, refrigerators at that period not having been
invented.</p>

<p>But the arrangements on board these ships were
defective in much more important matters than
in not providing a good table for the passengers.
The boats—even when they were seaworthy,
which frequently was not the case—were so few
in number that, in the event of shipwreck, there
was no possibility of their holding more than
a third of the souls on board. The longboat,
indeed, was practically useless in an emergency, as
it was almost invariably filled up with sheds for
the accommodation for the cow, sheep, and pigs;
and it would have been several hours’ work to
clear the boat and launch her.</p>

<p>The law did not then render it compulsory for
every vessel crossing the Atlantic to carry a
surgeon, and the owners of the various lines of
American packets would not incur the expense of
providing one. The consequence was that, if an
accident occurred or there was serious illness
on board, no medical assistance was available.
When I was returning to Europe in the <i>Mediator</i>
in 1842, a sailor fell from one of the yards, badly
fracturing his right leg. The commander of the
vessel was a Yankee—that is, a native of one
of the New England States—and he had the
ingenuity and readiness of resource which are
characteristic of the people of that section of the
Union. He so admirably set the injured limb
with splints, that, when the ship arrived at
London and the man was taken to Bartholomew
Hospital, the officials of that institution highly
complimented Captain Morgan upon the workmanlike
manner in which he had performed
the operation. The fact, however, remains, that
but for the purely fortuitous circumstance of
the commander of the vessel having been able to
deal with the case, the result of there being no
surgeon on board must have been that the injured
man would either have died, or been a cripple for
life.</p>

<p>If the cabin passengers had good cause to complain
that neither their safety nor their comfort
was sufficiently studied, the condition of the
steerage passengers was infinitely worse. Men,
women, and children were huddled like sheep
in the quarters assigned them, no separation of
the sexes being attempted. The berths, which
ran on either side of the vessel, were not inclosed,
and were without curtains. The women were
compelled to dress and undress before the eyes
of the male passengers, and exposed to their
coarse remarks and scurrilous jests. Indeed,
the moral downfall of many a poor girl was
to be attributed to her feelings of decency and
modesty having been blunted by her painful
experiences during the voyage.</p>

<p>The steerage passengers were required to both
supply and cook their own provisions. There
was commonly a fierce struggle for a place at
the galley fire, in which the sick and feeble
necessarily went to the wall; and sometimes
several days would pass without any warm food
being obtained by those who were most in need
of it. Again, when there was a storm, or even
when the ship experienced heavy weather, the
hatches were closed, rendering the atmosphere
of the steerage almost stifling. In fact, the
condition and treatment of this class of passengers
were simply abominable, and such as
to reflect deep discredit upon the government
for allowing so many years to elapse ere any
attempt was made to deal with the evil.</p>

<p>Now, all is changed. The steamers which at
the present day cross the Atlantic are vessels
ranging from four to seven thousand tons burden;
and the arrangements on board of them are excellent
in all respects. Besides the lifeboats—which
are numerous, large, and built on the
most approved models—there are rafts which, in
case of necessity, can be got ready and launched
in a few minutes. In the event, too, of a fire
breaking out in any part of the ship, the appliances
for extinguishing it are of the most thorough
character. In fact, the provision made for the
safety of the passengers would be all that could
be desired if every ship carried a sufficient number
of boats to accommodate, in case of disaster, <i>every</i>
passenger, even when her complement was full.
Note the late disaster to the <i>Oregon</i>.</p>

<p>The comfort of the travelling public is now
carefully studied. The cabins for the first-class
passengers are placed amidships, where the motion
of the vessel is least felt, instead of, as formerly,
at the stern. The staterooms are commodious,
handsomely furnished, thoroughly ventilated, and
heated by steam. The saloon, which is spacious
and well lighted, contains a piano, a small library,
bagatelle tables, chess, &amp;c., for the use of the
passengers. There are also smoking and reading
rooms and bathrooms, supplied with hot as well
as cold water. The table is so luxuriantly spread
that there is scarcely a delicacy which can be
obtained in the best hotels in London, found
lacking on board these steamers. The supply
of fresh water—furnished by condensers—is practically
unlimited; whilst that which is required
for drinking purposes is in summer cooled with
ice, of which a large stock is provided. A surgeon
is invariably carried, the law rendering it obligatory
to do so; and his services are at the disposal
of any of the passengers who needs them
without the payment of any fee.</p>

<p>Nor have the steerage passengers failed to
participate in the altered condition of things.
Instead of their being crowded together in the
badly ventilated and unhealthy quarters assigned
to them, as was formerly the case, it is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">{584}</span>
compulsory for a fixed cubic space to be allotted
to each individual. Not only, too, are the berths
inclosed—which is greatly conducive to the preservation
of decency—but the single women
occupy a separate compartment, in the charge
of a matron. But one of the greatest improvements
which has taken place in the condition
of occupants of the steerage has been effected
by the Act, passed a few years ago, requiring
cooked provisions being found by the owners
of the ship; and although the passage-money
is necessarily higher than it was under the old
system, this drawback is more than compensated
by the comfort which results from the present
arrangement.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I may say that, indulging in
a retrospect upon my experiences for the last
forty years—during which period I have crossed
the Atlantic ten times—I have been forcibly
struck by the contrast the peril, tedium, and
inconveniences then attendant upon an Atlantic
voyage afford to the safety, rapidity, and comfort
with which it is now accomplished.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIV.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning, Tom Dupuy, Esquire, of Pimento
Valley, Westmoreland, Trinidad, mounted his
celebrated chestnut pony Sambo Gal at his own
door, unchained his famous Cuban bloodhound
Slot from his big kennel, and rode up, with
cousinly and lover-like anxiety, to Orange Grove,
to inquire after Nora’s and her father’s safety.
Nora was up by the time he reached the house,
pale and tired, and with a frightful headache; but
she went to meet him at the front door, and
dropped him a very low old-fashioned obeisance.</p>

<p>‘Good-morning, Tom Dupuy!’ she said coldly.
‘So you’ve come at last to look us up, have
you? It’s very good of you, I’m sure, very
good of you. They tell me you didn’t come
last night, when half the gentlemen from all
the country round rode up in hot haste with
guns and pistols to take care of papa and me.
But it’s very good of you, to be sure, now the
danger’s well over, to come round in such a
friendly fashion and drop us a card of kind
inquiries.’</p>

<p>Even Tom Dupuy, born boor and fool as he
was, flushed up crimson at that galling taunt
from a woman’s lips, ‘Now that the danger’s
well over.’ To do him justice, Tom Dupuy was
indeed no coward; that was the one solitary
vice of which no fighting Dupuy that ever lived
could with justice be suspected for a moment.
He would have faced and fought a thousand
black rioters single-handed, like a thousand
fiends, himself, in defence of his beloved vacuum
pans and dearly cherished saccharometers and
boiling-houses. His devotion to molasses would
no doubt have been proof against the very utmost
terrors of death itself. But the truth is that
exact devotion in question was the real cause
of his apparent remissness on the previous evening.
All night long, Tom Dupuy had been
busy rousing and arming his immediate house-servants,
despatching messengers to Port-of-Spain
for the aid of the constabulary, and preparing
to defend the cut canes with the very last drop
of his blood and the very last breath in his stolid
body. At the first sight of the conflagration
at Orange Grove, he guessed at once that ‘the
niggers had risen;’ and he proceeded without
a moment’s delay to fortify roughly Pimento
Valley against the chance of a similar attack.
Now that he came to look back calmly upon
his heroic exertions, however, it did begin to
strike him somewhat forcibly that he had perhaps
shown himself slightly wanting in the
affection of a cousin and the ardour of a lover.
He bit his lip awkwardly for a second, with a
sheepish look; then he glanced up suddenly and
said with clumsy self-vindication: ‘It isn’t always
those that deserve the best of you that get the
best praise or thanks, in this world of ours, I
fancy, Nora!’</p>

<p>‘I fail to understand you,’ Nora answered with
quiet dignity.</p>

<p>‘Why, just you look here, Nora: it’s somehow
like this, I tell you plainly. Here was I
last night down at Pimento. I saw by the blaze
that these nigger fellows must have broken loose,
and must be burning down the Orange Grove
cane-houses; so there I stopped all night long,
working away as hard as I could work—no
nigger could have worked harder—trying to
protect your father’s canes and the vacuum pans
from these murdering, howling rebels. And now,
when I come round here this morning to tell
you, after having made sure the whole year’s
crop at old Pimento, one of your fine English
flouts is all the thanks I get from you, miss, for
my night’s labour.’</p>

<p>Nora laughed—laughed in spite of herself—laughed
aloud a simple, merry, girlish laugh of
pure amusement—it was so comical. There they
had all stood last night in imminent danger of
their lives, and of what is dearer than life
itself, surrounded by a frantic, yelling mob of
half-demented, rum-maddened negroes—her father
left for dead upon the piazza steps, Harry
Noel hacked with cutlasses before her very eyes,
herself trampled under foot in her swoon upon
the drawing-room floor by the naked soles
of those negro rioters—and now this morning,
Cousin Tom comes up quietly when all was over
to tell her at his ease how he had taken the
most approved precautions for the protection
of his beloved vacuum pans. Every time she
thought of it, Nora laughed again, with a fresh
little outburst of merry laughter, more and more
vehemently, just as though her father were not
at that very moment lying within between life
and death, as still and motionless as a corpse, in
his own bedroom.</p>

<p>There is nothing more fatal to the possible
prospects of a suitor, however hopeless, than to
be openly laughed at by the lady of his choice
at a critical moment—nothing more galling to
a man under any circumstances than patent
ridicule from a beautiful woman. Tom Dupuy
grew redder and redder every minute, and
stammered and stuttered in helpless speechlessness;
and still Nora looked at him and laughed,
‘for all the world,’ he thought to himself, ‘as
if I were just nobody else but the clown at the
theatre.’</p>

<p>But that was not indeed the stage on which
Tom Dupuy really performed the part of clown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">{585}</span>
with such distinguished success in his unconscious
personation.</p>

<p>‘How’s your father this morning?’ he asked
at last gruffly, with an uneasy shuffle. ‘I hear
the niggers cut him about awfully last night,
and next door to killed him with their beastly
cutlasses.’</p>

<p>Nora drew herself up and checked her untimely
laughter with a sudden sense of the demands
of the situation, as she answered once more in
her coldest tone: ‘My father is getting on as
well as we can expect, thank you, Mr Tom Dupuy.
We are much obliged to you for your kind inquiries.
He slept the night pretty well, all things
considered, and is partially conscious again this
morning. He was very nearly killed last night,
as you say; and if it hadn’t been for Mr Noel
and Mr Hawthorn, who kindly came up at
once and tried to protect us, he would have
been killed outright, and I with him. But Mr
Noel and Mr Hawthorn had happily no vacuum
pans and no trash-houses to engage their first
and chief attention.’</p>

<p>Tom Dupuy sneered visibly. ‘Hm!’ he said.
‘Two coloured fellows! Upon my conscience!
the Dupuys of Trinidad must be coming down
in the world, it seems, when they have to rely
for help in a nigger rising upon two coloured
fellows.’</p>

<p>‘If they’d had to rely upon white men like
you,’ Nora answered angrily, flushing crimson
as she spoke, ‘they’d have been burnt last night
upon the ashes of the cane-house, and not a
soul would have stirred a hand or foot to save
them or protect them.’</p>

<p>Tom laughed to himself a sharp, short, malicious
laugh. ‘Ha, ha!’ he said, ‘my fine English-bred
lady, so that’s the way the wind blows,
is it? I may be a fool, and I know you think
me one’—Nora bowed immediately a sarcastic
acquiescence—‘but I’m not such a fool as not
to see through a woman’s face into a woman’s
mind like an open window. I heard that that
woolly-headed Hawthorn man had been over
here and made a most cowardly time-serving
speech to the confounded niggers, giving way
to all their preposterous demands in the most
outrageous and ridiculous fashion; but I didn’t
hear that the other coloured fellow—your fine-spoken
English friend Noel’—he hissed the
words out with all the concentrated strength of
his impotent hatred—‘had been up here too,
to put his own finger into the pie when the
crust was burning. Just like his impudence!
the conceited coxcomb!’</p>

<p>‘Mr Noel is lying inside, in our own house
here, this very moment, dangerously wounded,’
Nora cried, her face now like a crimson peony;
‘and he was cut down by the negroes last night,
standing up bravely, alone and single-handed,
with no weapon but a little riding-whip, facing
those mad rebels like an angry tiger, and trying
to protect me from their insults and their
cutlasses; while you, sir, were stopping snugly
away down at Pimento Valley, looking carefully
after your canes and your vacuum pans. Tom
Dupuy, if you dare to say another word, now
or ever, in my hearing against the man who
tried to save my life from those wild wretches
at the risk of his own, as sure as I’m standing
here, sir, I give you fair notice I’ll chastise you
myself, as soon as I’ll look at you, you cowardly
backbiter!—And now, Mr Dupuy, good-morning.’</p>

<p>Tom saw the game was fairly up and his
hand outwitted. It was no use arguing with
her any longer. ‘When she’s in this humour,’
he said to himself philosophically, ‘you might
as well try to reason with a wounded lioness.’
So he whistled carelessly for Slot to fellow,
lifted his hat as politely as he was able—he
didn’t pretend to all these fine new-fangled
town-bred ways of Harry Noel’s—jumped with
awkward agility upon his chestnut pony,
turned its head in the direction of Pimento
Valley, and delivered a parting Parthian shot
from a safe distance, just as he got beyond
the garden gateway. ‘Good-by, Miss Nora,’ he
said then savagely, raising his hat a second
time with sarcastic courtesy: ‘good-bye for ever.
This is our last meeting. And remember that
I always said you’d finish in the end, for all
your fine English education, in marrying a
confounded woolly-headed brown man!’</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XLV.</h3>

<p>All day long, Mr Dupuy lay speechless and
almost motionless on his bed, faint with loss
of blood, and hovering between life and death,
but gradually mending by imperceptible degrees,
as Marian fancied. The brain had been terribly
shaken, and there were some symptoms of stunning
and concussion; but the main trouble was
merely the excessive drain on the vascular system
from the long-continued and unchecked bleeding.
About mid-day, he became hot and feverish, with
a full pulse, beating unsteadily. Macfarlane, who
had remained in the house all night, ordered
him at once a rough mixture of sal-volatile,
bismuth, and whisky. ‘And whatever ye do,’
he said emphatically, ‘don’t forget the whisky—a
good wine-glassful in half a pint of cold
water.’</p>

<p>Mr Dupuy was raised in the bed to drink
the mixture, which he swallowed mechanically in
a half-unconscious fashion; and then a bandage
of pounded ice was applied to his forehead, and
leeches were hastily sent for to Port-of-Spain
to reduce the inflammation. Long before the
leeches had time to arrive, however, Nora, who
was watching by his bedside, observed that his
eyes began to open more frequently than before,
and that gleams of reason seemed to come over
them every now and again for brief intervals.
‘Give him some more whisky,’ Macfarlane said
in his decided tone; ‘there’s nothing like it,
nothing like it—in these cases—especially for a
man of Dupuy’s idiosyncrasy.’</p>

<p>At that moment Mr Dupuy’s lips moved
feebly, and he tried to turn with an effort on
the pillow.</p>

<p>‘Hush, hush!’ Nora cried; ‘he wants to speak.
He has something to tell us. What is it he’s
saying? Listen, listen!’</p>

<p>Mr Dupuy’s lips moved again, and a faint
voice proceeded slowly from the depths of his
bosom: ‘Not fit to hold a candle to old Trinidad
rum, I tell you, doctor.’</p>

<p>Macfarlane rubbed his hand against his thigh
with evident pleasure and satisfaction. ‘He’s
wrong there,’ he murmured, ‘undoubtedly wrong,
as every judicious person could easily tell him;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">{586}</span>
but no matter. He’ll do now, when once he’s
got life enough left in him to contradict one.
It always does a Dupuy good to contradict other
people. Let it be rum, then—a wine-glassful
of Mr Tom’s best stilling.’</p>

<p>Almost as soon as the rum was swallowed,
Mr Dupuy seemed to mend rapidly for the
passing moment. He looked up and saw Nora.
‘That’s well then,’ he said with a sigh, recollecting
suddenly the last night’s adventures. ‘So
they didn’t kill you after all, Nora?’</p>

<p>Nora stooped down with unwonted tenderness
and kissed him fervently. ‘No, papa,’ she said;
‘they didn’t; nor you either.’</p>

<p>Mr Dupuy paused for a moment; then he
looked up a second time, and asked, with extraordinary
vehemence for an invalided man: ‘Is
this riot put down? Have they driven off the
niggers? Have they taken the ringleaders?
Have they hanged Delgado?’</p>

<p>‘Hush, hush!’ Nora cried, a little appalled
in her cooler mood, after all that had happened,
at this first savage outcry for vengeance. ‘You
mustn’t talk, papa; you mustn’t excite yourself.
Yes, yes; the riot is put down, and Delgado—Delgado
is dead. He has met with his due
punishment.’</p>

<p>‘That’s well!’ Mr Dupuy exclaimed, with
much gusto, in spite of his weakness, rubbing
his hands feebly underneath the bedclothes.
‘Serves the villain right. I’m glad they’ve
hanged him. Nothing on earth comes up to
martial law in these emergencies; and hang ’em
on the spot, say I, as fast as you catch ’em,
red-handed! Flog ’em first, and hang ’em afterwards!’</p>

<p>Marian looked down at him speechless, with
a shudder of horror; but Nora put her face
between her hands, overwhelmed with awe, now
her own passion had burst itself out, at that
terrible outburst of the old bad barbaric spirit
of retaliation. ‘Don’t let him talk so, dear,’ she
cried to Marian. ‘O Marian, Marian, I’m so
ashamed of myself! I’m so ashamed of us all—us
Dupuys, I mean; I wish we were all more
like you and Mr Hawthorn.’</p>

<p>‘You must not speak, Mr Dupuy,’ Macfarlane
said, interposing gently, with his rough-and-ready
Scotch tenderness. ‘Ye’re not strong enough
for conversation yet, I’m thinking. Ye must just
take a wee bit sleep till the fever’s reduced.
Ye’ve had a narrow escape of your life, my dear
sir; and ye must not excite yourself the minute
ye’re getting a trifle better.’</p>

<p>The old man lay silent for a few minutes
longer; then he turned again to Nora, and
without noticing Marian’s presence, said more
vehemently and more viciously than ever: ‘I
know who set them on to this, Nora. It wasn’t
their own doing; it was coloured instigation.
They were put up to it—I know they were
put up to it—by that scoundrel Hawthorn—a
seditious, rascally, malevolent lawyer, if ever
there was one. I hope they’ll hang him too—he
deserves it soundly—flog him and hang him
as soon as they catch him!’</p>

<p>‘O papa, papa!’ Nora cried, growing hotter
and redder in the face than ever, and clutching
Marian’s hand tightly in an agony of distress
and shamefacedness, ‘you don’t know what
you’re saying! You don’t know what you owe
to him! It was Mr Hawthorn who finally
pacified and dispersed the negroes; and if it
hadn’t been for his coolness and his bravery,
we wouldn’t one of us have been alive to say
so this very minute!’</p>

<p>Mr Dupuy coughed uneasily, and muttered to
himself once more in a vindictive undertone:
‘Hang him when they catch him!—hang him
when they catch him! I’ll speak to the governor
about it myself, and prove to him conclusively
that if it hadn’t been for this fellow Hawthorn,
the niggers’d never have dreamed of kicking up
such a hullabaloo and bobbery!’</p>

<p>‘But, papa,’ Nora began again, her eyes full
of tears, ‘you don’t understand. You’re all
wrong about it. If it hadn’t been for that dear,
good, brave Mr Hawthorn’——</p>

<p>Marian touched her lightly on the shoulder.
‘Never mind about it, Nora, darling,’ she whispered
consolingly, with a womanly caress to the
poor shrinking girl at her elbow; ‘don’t trouble
him with the story now. By-and-by, when he’s
better, he’ll come to hear the facts; and then
he’ll know what Edward’s part was in the whole
matter. Don’t distress yourself about it, darling,
now, after all that has happened. I know your
father’s feelings too well to take amiss anything
he may happen to say in the heat of the
moment.’</p>

<p>‘If you speak another word before six o’clock,
to-night, Dupuy,’ Macfarlane put in with stern
determination, ‘I’ll just clear every soul that
knows ye out of the room at once, and leave you
alone to the tender mercies of old Aunt Clemmy.
Turn over on your side, man, when your doctor
tells ye to, and try to get a little bit of refreshing
sleep before the evening.’</p>

<p>Mr Dupuy obeyed in a feeble fashion; but he
still muttered doggedly to himself as he turned
over: ‘Catch him and hang him! Prove it to
the governor!’</p>

<p>As he spoke, Edward beckoned Marian out
into the drawing-room through the open door,
to show her a note which had just been brought
to him by a mounted orderly. It was a few
hasty lines, written in pencil, that very morning
by the governor himself, thanking Mr Hawthorn
in his official capacity for his brave and conciliatory
conduct on the preceding evening,
whereby a formidable and organised insurrection
had been nipped in the bud, and a door left
open for future inquiry, and redress of any
possible just grievances on the part of the rioters
and discontented negroes. ‘It is to your firmness
and address alone,’ the governor wrote, ‘that
the white population of the island of Trinidad
owes to-day its present security from fire and
bloodshed.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile, preparations had been made for
preventing any possible fresh outbreak of the
riot that evening; and soldiers and policemen
were arriving every moment at the smouldering
site of the recent fire, and forming a regular
plan of defence against the remote chance of a
second rising. Not that any such precautions
were really necessary; for the negroes, deprived
of their head in Delgado, were left utterly without
cohesion or organisation; and Edward’s promise
to go to England and see that their grievances
were properly ventilated had had far more
effect upon their trustful and excitable natures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">{587}</span>
than the display of ten regiments of soldiers in
marching order could possibly have produced.
The natural laziness of the negro mind, combining
with their confidence in the young judge, and
their fervent faith in the justice of Providence
under the most apparently incongruous circumstances,
had made them all settle down at once
into their usual listless <i>laissez-faire</i> condition, as
soon as the spur of Delgado’s fiery energy and
exhortation had ceased to stimulate them. ‘It
all right,’ they chattered passively among themselves.
‘Mistah Hawtorn gwine to ’peak to
Missis Queen fur de poor naygur; an’ de Lard
in hebben gwine to watch ober him, an’ see
him doan’t suffer no more wrong at de heavy
hand ob de proud buckra.’</p>

<p>When the time arrived to make preparations
for the night’s watching and nursing, Nora
came to Marian once more with her spirit vexed
by a sore trouble. ‘My dear,’ she said, ‘this is
a dreadful thing about poor Mr Noel having to
go on stopping here. It’s very unfortunate he
couldn’t have been nursed through his illness
at your house or at Captain Castello’s. He’ll
be down in bed for at least a week or two, in
all probability; and it won’t be possible to move
him out of this until he’s better.’</p>

<p>‘Well, darling?’ Marian answered, with an
inquiring smile.</p>

<p>‘Well, you see, Marian, it wouldn’t be so
awkward, of course, if poor papa wasn’t ill
too, because then, if I liked, I could go over
and stop with you at Mulberry until Mr Noel
was quite recovered. But as I shall have to
stay here, naturally, to nurse papa, why’——</p>

<p>‘Why, what then, Nora?’</p>

<p>Nora hesitated. ‘Why, you see, darling,’ she
went on timidly at last, ‘people will say that
as I’ve helped to nurse Mr Noel through a
serious illness’——</p>

<p>‘Yes, dear?’</p>

<p>‘O Marian, don’t be so stupid! Of course,
in that case, everybody’ll expect me—to—to—accept
him.’</p>

<p>Marian looked down deep into her simple, little,
girlish eyes with a curious smile of arch womanliness.
‘And why not, Nora?’ she asked at last
with perfect simplicity.</p>

<p>Nora blushed. ‘Marian—Marian—dear Marian,’
she said at length, after a long pause, ‘you are
so good—you are so kind—you are so helpful to
me. I wish I could say to you all I feel, but I
can’t; and even if I did, you couldn’t understand
it—you couldn’t fathom it. You don’t know
what it is, Marian, to be born a West Indian
with such a terrible load of surviving prejudices.
O darling, darling, we are all so full of wicked,
dreadful, unjust feelings! I wish I could be
like you, dear, I wish indeed I could; but I
can’t, I can’t, I can’t, somehow!’</p>

<p>Marian stroked her white little hand with
sisterly tenderness in perfect silence for a few
minutes; then she said, rather reproachfully:
‘So you wish Mr Noel wasn’t going to be
nursed under your father’s roof at all, Nora!
That’s a very poor return, isn’t it, my darling,
for all his bravery and heroism and devotion?’</p>

<p>Nora drew back like one bitten suddenly by a
venomous creature, and putting her hand in
haste on her breast, as if it pained her terribly,
answered, with a little deep-drawn sigh: ‘It
isn’t that, Marian—it isn’t that, darling. You
know what it is, dear, as well as I do. Don’t
say it’s that, my sweet; oh, don’t say it’s
that, or you’ll kill me, you’ll kill me with
remorse and anger! You’ll make me hate
myself, if you say I’m ungrateful. But I’m
not ungrateful, Marian—I’m not ungrateful. I
admire, and—and love him; yes, I love him,
for the way he acted here last evening.’ And
as she spoke, she buried her head fervidly, with
shame and fear, in Marian’s bosom.</p>

<p>Marian smoothed her hair tenderly for a few
minutes longer, this time again in profound
silence, and then she spoke once more very
softly, almost at Nora’s ear, in a low whisper.
‘I went this morning into Mr Noel’s room,’
she said, ‘darling, just when he was first
beginning to recover consciousness; and as he
saw me, he turned his eyes up to me with a
beseeching look, and his lips seemed to be moving,
as if he wanted ever so much to say something.
So I stooped down and listened to catch the
words he was trying to frame in his feverish
fashion. He said at first just two words—“Miss
Dupuy;” and then he spoke again, and said
one only—“Nora.” I smiled, and nodded at him
to tell him it was all well; and he spoke again,
quite audibly: “Have they hurt her? Have
they hurt her?” I said: “No; she’s as well as
I am!” and his eyes seemed to grow larger as
I said it, and filled with tears; and I knew
what he meant by them, Nora—I knew what
he meant by them. A little later, he spoke to
me again, and he said: “Mrs Hawthorn, I
may be dying; and if I die, tell her—tell
Nora—that last night, when she stood beside
me there so bravely, I loved her, I loved
her better even than I had ever loved her!”
He won’t die, Nora; but still I’ll break his
confidence, darling, and tell it you this evening.—O
Nora, Nora! you say you wish to goodness
you hadn’t got all these dreadful, wicked, West
Indian feelings. You’re brave enough—I know
that—no woman braver. Why don’t you have
the courage to break through them, then, and
come away with Edward and me to England,
and accept poor Mr Noel, who would gladly
give his very life a thousand times over for
you, darling?’</p>

<p>Nora burst into tears once more, and nestled,
sobbing, closer and closer upon Marian’s shoulder.</p>

<p>‘My darling,’ she cried, ‘I’m too wicked! I only
wish I could feel as you do!’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SWIMMING">SWIMMING.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> extent to which the power of swimming is
cultivated amongst Englishmen is scarcely creditable
to the citizens of a country which boasts both
that it is the greatest naval power, and that it
possesses infinitely the largest mercantile marine
on the face of the earth. It is only within recent
years that it has been anything but a rare
exception for a sailor to be able to swim.
Amongst old naval officers it is still remembered
as a notable occurrence that some fifty years ago,
Lord Ingestre, when in command of a ship on
the Mediterranean station, refused to rate as an
able seaman any man who could not swim, and
that from time to time other captains followed
his example. That this should be still recalled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">{588}</span>
to mind shows how rare an accomplishment
swimming was amongst sailors in past times;
and if this has now been remedied in the royal
navy, where, at the present day, swimming is
taught, a similar improvement has by no means
taken place in the mercantile marine, in which
a seaman who can swim is still a curiosity.
Probably the same remark would apply to our
‘long-shore’ population, to our lightermen and
professional watermen, and to the inhabitants of
our numerous canal-boats. And yet English
people of both sexes and of the average type
seem to take to the water as naturally as a
duck. The difference is that they delight to
disport themselves on the waves instead of in
them. Every seaport, every suitable stretch of
river, every lake, has its Rowing Club; Cockneys,
whose ideas of rowing are original if not elegant,
and whose notions of boat-management constitute
a minus quantity, make summer Sundays and
the August Bank Holiday hideous on the Thames
in the neighbourhood of Hampton Court; and
if ’Arry takes his ’Arriet for a day’s excursion
to some one of the seaside resorts which they
patronise, the enjoyment of both is incomplete if
they do not court the woes of sea-sickness by
going for a sail.</p>

<p>In face of this national taste for aquatic
pursuits, it is a painfully suggestive reflection
that comparatively few Englishmen, and still
fewer Englishwomen, possess sufficient knowledge
of swimming to save their own lives if they
were suddenly plunged into deep water, and
were called upon to support themselves for,
perhaps, five minutes by their own exertions.
No doubt, the power of swimming is a far
more common accomplishment amongst men than
it was a quarter of a century ago. Swimming
has shared in the athletic revival which has
marked the period, and has found its devotees
amongst the practical adherents of muscular
Christianity; but if, as some seem to think,
there are not wanting signs that the rage for
athletic pursuits has passed its meridian, and has
begun its decline, swimming will probably suffer,
in common with other sports, from the reaction.
No doubt, too, our changeful English climate,
our cold waters, are against this particular form
of exercise. In the tideless, sun-warmed Mediterranean,
in the coral-bound lagoons of the Southern
Ocean, or by the grove-clad banks of Burmese
rivers, swimming becomes both a luxury and a
second nature. Let those testify who remember
the untrammelled urchins flinging themselves
from the bows of boats in Malta harbour to dive
for and secure the coins flung from the deck of
some newly arrived vessel, or disporting themselves
day after day in the fetid, drain-polluted
waters of the Dockyard Creek. Let travellers
bear witness who, with possibly some humorous
exaggeration, have told us how, in Burmah,
toddling infants can swim at least as soon as
they can walk; and how a mother, too busy for
the time to look after her youngest born, will
cheerfully and confidently place it in the river,
to amuse itself with its playmates; and then,
when she has leisure, will swim about among
the gamboling children until she has found her
own and brought it to land. In such a case as
this there can be but little teaching; swimming
must come almost naturally—shall we say from
hereditary instinct, developed by the constant
calls made upon it, and transmitted from generation
to generation?</p>

<p>The lower temperature of the sea, or of fresh
water fully exposed to the air, in our latitudes
will doubtless always prevent Englishmen, as a
nation, from becoming expert swimmers; but
the common-sense of a people which prides
itself on its possession of the quality should
suffice to evade or overcome this natural obstacle
so far as to release us from at least a large proportion
of the grim death-tribute which we pay
every year to our national ignorance. To any
one who has noted the characteristic recklessness
with which people intrust themselves to frail
craft with whose management they are ludicrously
unacquainted, it may perhaps be a matter for
surprise that this tribute is not more heavy than
it is; but certainly not a few of the deaths by
drowning that go to swell our annual calendar
of disasters can only be properly called accidents
if we extend the signification of the word so as
to include those misfortunes which, though unforeseen,
arise from perfectly preventable causes.
The climate of Paris and the north of France is
not warmer than that of England, but the proportion
of Parisians—perhaps even of Frenchmen
in general—who can swim is certainly greater
than that of Englishmen. When it was pointed
out to the librarian at Boulogne-sur-Mer that
the library did not possess a single work on
swimming, he replied good-humouredly: ‘Ah!
c’est comme ça, Monsieur—on apprend naturellement
ici;’ and in Thévenot’s <i>Art de Nager,
démontré par Figures, avec des Avis pour se baigner
utilement</i>, published in Paris in or about 1696,
some of the plates represent ladies swimming,
and would thus seem to show that with Frenchwomen
it has been a custom for centuries. In
the year 1859, Miss Powers, the secretary to the
Ladies’ National Association for the diffusion
of sanitary knowledge, published a twopenny
pamphlet entitled, <i>Why do not Women Swim?—a
Voice from many Waters</i>; but the question
thus propounded was not satisfactorily answered,
and an Englishwoman who can swim still remains
a rarity—how great a one, any one may easily
ascertain for himself by watching the small crowd
that speedily assembles to watch a lady-swimmer
at any seaside resort.</p>

<p>In extenuation of our national ignorance of
swimming, we have not even the excuse that
the acquisition of the art is difficult. On the
contrary, it is one of the most easily acquired
of accomplishments. The one secret of it is confidence,
though, like most other things, it is best
learned young. There is no reason why it should
not—on the contrary, on the ground both of
health and of saving of life, there is every reason
why it should—be made a necessary part of the
education of young people of both sexes and of
all classes. At Eton and in some other schools,
it is systematically taught; but it would be far
cheaper and more useful than many of the things
for which parents cheerfully pay as ‘extras’ in
private establishments; whilst in these days, when
we are concerning ourselves so greatly about the
education of the masses, and paying such a price
for the privilege, swimming would certainly be
a far more useful subject to form one of the
items of Board School education than many of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">{589}</span>
the things for which the long-suffering ratepayer
is now compelled to put his hand in his pocket.

<p>This is the merest doggerel. In fact, the recommendation
of the book is not its literary merit,
for it possesses none, but the fact that it is what
it professes to be—in itself a matter of congratulation
after the nonsense which, from time to
time, it has been sought to palm off upon the
public by utilising the names of various prominent
swimmers who were far too ignorant to
have written a line of the compilations with
which their names have been associated—and
that the instruction conveyed in it is thoroughly
sound, practical, and to the point. Woodbridge
died in 1868; and the little manual has, I believe,
been long out of print, so that in saying this I
may be acquitted of the desire to give any one
a gratuitous advertisement. I come back, however,
to my point: Why, provided there be water
at hand, should not every one be taught to swim
during the period of his or her school career;
and how can parents reconcile it to their consciences
to permit their children to run a perfectly
needless risk, by failing to have them taught what
they ought to learn as regularly and easily as they
learn to walk?</p>

<h3 title="CHAP. II.">IN FOUR CHAPTERS.—CHAP. II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> and Lucy Wedlake were two young people
who had loved one another well enough, and had
had sufficient courage to marry on two hundred
pounds a year in the teeth of their respective
families, both of which were highly respectable,
extremely proud, but very poor. Tom was
a Civil Service clerk, aged twenty-eight, whose
salary had reached the above annual sum; and
it was insisted by all their relations that the
young people ought to wait until he should
get his first class—which he might hope to do
about forty—and be in receipt of three hundred
a year; that being the smallest income
upon which any lady and gentleman could
contrive to support existence together. The
pair declined to accept this view; so they got
married; and Tom took his pretty gentle wife to
live in a little house on the north-east of the
Regent’s Park, which he had furnished with
money lent him, free of interest, by a well-to-do
friend. For the rest, they were content to trust
to youth, health, and determination to keep from
absolute destitution themselves and any little
folks who might hereafter come.</p>

<p>They did not, after all, find the struggle so
terrible as it had been described to them. They
were not blessed—or burdened—with children
until they had been some time married, nor
until circumstances had put it into their
power to maintain and educate them without
difficulty; and they had no expensive tastes.
They were extremely fond of one another, and
lived in great happiness for one year. Then
Uncle Franklin took up his abode with them,
and their happiness was for a time considerably
clouded. Mr Franklin was Lucy’s maternal
uncle. In his business—that of a wine-merchant—he
had made money, which he
had increased by successful speculation. But
in proportion as his purse grew bulky, his
manners deteriorated. The latter fact was forgiven
in consideration of the former; and by
the time he retired, the master of a moderate
fortune, the family toleration of him had developed
into positive affection. Yet he was as
we have seen him—rough, harsh, coarse, selfish,
and overbearing; faults which were easily overlooked
by the half-dozen sets of brothers and
sisters, plentifully garnished with nephews and
nieces, who remembered only that Uncle Franklin
was old, rich, and a bachelor, and forgot the
wine-merchant’s business, and the continual snubs
and insults which it had always been the old
gentleman’s pleasure to inflict upon his affectionate
relatives. So that, when he began to
lament the loneliness of his age, and to hint at his
longings for the comforts and pleasures of family
life, quite a number of hospitable doors flew open
to him on the instant. Uncle Franklin entered
all those doors, and left each of them before
many weeks were over, shaking the dust off his
feet against the inhabitants. In every house
which he honoured with a brief sojourn, he
comported himself more like a fiend than a
human being. His selfishness, his ill-temper, his
insolence, his coarseness, his tyranny, his general
powers of exasperation, would have been unendurable
by any save possible legatees, whose
meekness, however, instead of disarming the old
savage, seemed to incite him to yet greater
cruelties. The end was the same in every case.
He would fasten some perfectly unreasonable
quarrel upon his hosts, and fling out of the house
in a furious passion; subsequently amusing himself
by inditing from his next abode injurious
replies to the petitions for pardon and reconciliation
which pursued him.</p>

<p>One day a cab drove up to Tom Wedlake’s door,
and Uncle Franklin, alighting therefrom, walked
into the parlour, plumped himself into the most
comfortable armchair, and announced his intention
of remaining, adding that his luggage would
arrive shortly. Lucy, in consternation, entertained
him as well as she could, which did
not appear to be very well, until her husband
came home and they were able to take counsel
together.</p>

<p>Tom was at first entirely opposed to the whole
thing; and being himself of a somewhat fiery
temper, hinted at forcible expulsion as a means
of solving the difficulty. But Lucy begged him
to do nothing hastily, and suggested that the self-invited
guest might at all events remain for a few
days, until they should be able to see for themselves
whether he were in reality so black as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">{590}</span>
had been painted. And whether it was the
excellence of the little dinner which Lucy dished
up, or the bright though homely comfort around
him, or certain indications in Tom’s look and
manner, the dreadful uncle, having come in like
a lion, seemed disposed to remain in the character
of a lamb. He actually tried, in the course of
the evening, to pay Lucy a compliment on her
good looks, which only missed fire because no
one could possibly have understood it.</p>

<p>Before he went to bed, Uncle Franklin
repeated his proposal, offering very liberal
terms; and he lamented his lonely old age
and the evident disposition of all his relatives
to quarrel with him, in a way which went to
Lucy’s soft heart. Even Tom, than whom
there was no better fellow breathing, was taken
in so far that he forgot much that he had
heard of the woes attending Uncle Franklin’s
irruption into any household. It so happened
that he had never troubled Lucy’s own family
circle, who alone of all his relatives lived at
some distance from London. The young couple
sat late that night, discussing the matter from all
sides, and at last determined to make the trial.
Lucy was influenced partly by pity, partly by
the hope, which had in it little indeed of the
mercenary element, that her uncle might leave
her some small legacy, so that her darling
husband might not, after all, have an altogether
undowered bride. Tom, on his side, thought
only of the wife he loved; the additional income
would enable her to keep another servant, would
relieve her from hard and menial labour, and
would even afford her some few little feminine
luxuries which had hitherto been beyond her
reach. So each, for the other’s sake, was willing
to bow the back for the burden.</p>

<p>For a time all went well. The old man seemed
to have made a sudden and vast amendment.
True, he was generally irritable, always selfish,
and sometimes expressed himself in rather odd
language. But these, after all, were mere eccentricities,
failings of old age, results of a life apart
from all refining influences. They were not
insupportable by two people who had youth,
health, and good spirits to their aid. And it
was evident that Uncle Franklin had taken a
fancy to his niece. He liked to have her sitting
near him at work; and she made an exemplary
listener while he fought over again the battles
of business, or indulged in tirades against the
baseness and ingratitude of mankind in general
and his other relations in particular. To Tom
he was civil, and even friendly after his fashion;
altogether, he was an endurable inmate; and
his entertainers began to believe that the tales
which they had heard must at least have been
highly coloured.</p>

<p>But after a month of this, Tom and Lucy began
to discover that very little present advantage was
likely to result to them from the arrangement,
which was also irksome in many ways. Uncle
Franklin paid well; but then his ideas on the
subjects of eating and drinking and minor
luxuries were on an even more liberal scale. In
fact, after his requirements in this way were
provided for, and the expense of the necessary
additional servant met, there was little or no
margin of profit remaining. And the demands
upon Lucy’s time and energies were considerable.
Uncle Franklin liked attention, and was
unsparing in exacting it; he was, in truth, something
of an invalid, which perhaps partly
accounted for his temper and other peculiarities;
so that Tom began to think seriously of
hinting to his guest that it was hardly convenient
to entertain him longer; when one evening the
old man, being alone with his host and in an
unusually equable frame of mind, made an
explicit declaration of his intentions. Having
first anathematised all his other relations in a
general but very hearty manner, he vowed that
his niece and her husband were so far the only
people with whom he had been able to get on;
that he found himself more comfortable with
them than he had ever been in his life; and
that, with their permission, he proposed to end
his days in their company. Tom looked a little
awkward; but Mr Franklin, as if guessing at
what was in his mind, went on to say that on
this condition he should make Lucy his sole
legatee; there being, as he considered, no one
who had a better claim upon him, or to whom
he would willingly leave a fraction of his wealth.
Of course Tom could only express his grateful
acknowledgments. He was too poor, his prospects
were too uncertain for him to be justified in
standing in the light of his wife and possible
children; so Uncle Franklin was given to understand
that his proposal was accepted.</p>

<p>Lucy was full of delight when her husband told
her what had passed; but Tom himself was by no
means disposed to be sanguine.</p>

<p>‘It’s all very well, little woman,’ said he; ‘and
so far he has behaved with tolerable decency. But
I don’t think he’s exactly a person to be trusted.
You see, he is very comfortable here, thanks to
you, and he is undeniably selfish. Naturally,
he would like to stay; and some men will say
or promise anything to get what they want at
the moment. Let him stay, by all means; we
must not throw away such a chance. But don’t
allow yourself to build too much on his promises,
my dear. I, for my part, shall not be at all
surprised if he gets tired of us, and quarrels with
us, as he has with the rest; nor even if we find,
after he has ended his days here and got all he
can out of us, that his money is left elsewhere.’</p>

<p>Lucy said little, but she could not bring herself
to believe in the existence of such duplicity, and
in her heart she was convinced of her uncle’s <i>bona
fides</i>. She even felt a little shocked that her
husband, whom she so loved and admired, could
entertain such narrow and unworthy suspicions;
and she resolved that, so far as it depended on
her, the old man should have no just cause to
reconsider his testamentary intentions.</p>

<p>But it is to be feared that this attack of
amiability, coupled with the repression of the
past few weeks, had put a strain upon Uncle
Franklin which he was unable to bear. Perhaps
he thought that his munificent promise entitled
him to relax a little; perhaps he considered that
he had now made his footing in the house
absolutely safe. However that may have been,
within a very few days after this conversation,
the old Adam began to appear in him once more.
In Tom’s presence, he was still on his good
behaviour, having an instinctive fear of him, as
one not likely to submit tamely to oppression.
But Tom was absent all day at his office; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">{591}</span>
when Uncle Franklin had no one to withstand
him but a woman, and a very timid and gentle
one to boot, he began to ‘let himself out.’ His
powers of fault-finding were perfectly microscopic;
he passed his time in devising vexations and
enjoying them with the keenest relish. As for
his language, it daily increased in majesty and
ornament. He spoke to the servants in such
a manner that one of them—the new one—threatened
to give warning, and was with difficulty
persuaded to remain; and Lucy was
obliged to keep them as much as possible from
contact with her guest. He would begin with
a grumble at some trifle, round which he would
gradually crystallise his grievances, and work
himself up by their contemplation into a condition
of insane rage, in which he would amble
about the room like an angry baboon, knocking
down chairs and scattering verbal brimstone all
around. On these occasions, his liking for Lucy
seemed to disappear altogether, and he would
indulge in the most unpleasant criticisms on
her appearance, her intellect, and her housekeeping
abilities. Neither would he spare her
husband, whom he was accustomed to sum up
with similarly uncomplimentary results, inviting
Lucy to report his comments to their object—a
course which, he understood very well, nothing
would induce her to take.</p>

<p>She bore it all heroically. She knew what the
consequence would be if the slightest hint of the
treatment to which she was subjected should ever
reach Tom’s ears; so she contented herself with
uncomplaining good-temper so long as that was
possible, and tears—which added fuel to her
uncle’s wrath—when endurance was pushed
beyond its limits. Of her own profit she thought
little; or rather, the loss of her expectations
would have seemed to her humble and contented
nature but a small price to pay for release from
her sufferings. But for Tom’s sake—in the hope
of seeing him relieved of that anxiety for her
future which she knew to be always present
to his mind—for the sake of those who might
hereafter cling around her knees—she was prepared
to endure silently the worst that Uncle
Franklin could do to her.</p>

<p>This state of things, however, came to a sudden
end in a manner to her most unwelcome. Her
husband came home one afternoon much earlier
than usual. He had thought of late that his
wife looked rather pale and worn, and had
resolved to treat her to a little dinner at a
restaurant, and to take her afterwards to the
theatre, in the hope that the outing might give
her a much-needed fillip. The consequence was
that he met her unexpectedly, as she came
out of the dining-room. Could she have had
a few moments’ time, she would have utilised
it in sponging her eyes and generally smoothing
down her ruffled plumage, for this was
one of the days on which she had given way
under Uncle Franklin’s inflictions; her face was
all blurred with tears, and she was sobbing
so that she could not immediately stop. All
that he had heard of the old man rushed into
Tom’s mind, and he suspected at once the state
of the case. He took her up-stairs, and then and
there had it all out of her, with that gentle
and perfectly unbending firmness which she could
never resist. He said no more than to bid his
little wife dry her eyes and be comforted, kissed
her, and went down-stairs, quite deaf to her
feeble efforts to excuse the offender. Uncle
Franklin had a bad half-hour of it that afternoon;
he probably heard more solid truth than he had
been favoured with for many years. It was
never exactly known what Tom said to him;
but before bedtime that night, it was quite
understood by all the household that their guest
was under orders to quit within a week. Uncle
Franklin did not utter a word all the evening,
but sat in his armchair, blinking furtively at
his host, feeling guilty and detected, but yet unrepentant.
Before he went to bed, he announced
his intention of keeping to his own room for the
remainder of his stay, and requested that a fire
might be lit there in the morning. Also, he
wrote a letter, and sent a servant to post it.
This letter it was which occasioned Mr Blackford’s
visit.</p>

<p>That worthy solicitor prepared the will, which
was very short and simple, with the care demanded
by a document of such importance to his own
interests. He even took the precaution to fair-copy
it for signature himself, so as to pay strict
regard to the desire of the testator that no
inkling of its purport should leak out prematurely;
and with it he next day repaired to
Camden Town, taking with him, as requested,
two witnesses—his own clerk, and a writer in the
employ of his law-stationer.</p>

<p>Mr Franklin chuckled a great deal as he
wrote his name. ‘You can take it away and
keep it yourself, Blackford,’ said he, after the
witnesses had done their part and retired; ‘I’ll
warrant you to take good care of it.—By the way,
I don’t think the date’s inserted.’</p>

<p>The solicitor began to unbutton the greatcoat,
in an inner pocket of which he had buried the
precious piece of paper.</p>

<p>‘Oh, bother that! Do it when you get back.
It’s your concern—not mine. I’ve had enough
of you for one while; and I feel confoundedly
queer. I suppose this business has upset me,
though I don’t know why it should. It wouldn’t
have done so, once on a time.—Good-day.’ And,
nothing loth, Mr Blackford took himself off
with his treasure.</p>

<p>The prize was his; but only conditionally.
This unreliable testator might alter his mind
at any moment and undo his freak. Mr Blackford,
with all his faults, was not murderously
inclined; but it is to be feared that if some
burglar in the pursuit of his calling had found
it necessary to eliminate Mr Franklin that night,
and had confided his intentions beforehand to
the solicitor, something would have happened
to prevent that gentleman from warning the
police. He re-entered his office with a sigh.
Never had it appeared to him so gloomy as at
this moment, when, with the possibility of future
wealth in his pocket, he found himself still
confronted with the necessity of solving that
difficult and importunate bread-and-cheese problem.</p>

<p>Uncle Franklin had rightly estimated his
chances of remaining an inmate of the Wedlake
nest. On the morning after the execution of
his will, he came down to the dining-room at
breakfast-time, and then and there ate humble-pie
with the best grace he could assume. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">{592}</span>
apologised formally to Lucy, and promised never
to repeat his behaviour. He pleaded to Tom
his failing health and increasing age, and drew
a moving picture of himself as an outcast upon
the world, at the mercy of landladies; and he
did this with a certain rough pathos which produced
its effect. Tom was very short and stern
in his replies, and would commit himself to
nothing definite, but promised to think the
matter over during the day. And when he
returned at night, Lucy the soft-hearted met him
with an appeal, before which he gave way.</p>

<p>‘He has been very humble and quiet all day,’
said she. ‘I think, my boy—so savage about
his little wife!—has quite broken the poor old
man’s spirit. I don’t think we ought to send
him away. Of course, there is the money;
and it’s nonsense to pretend that we shouldn’t
be glad if he were to leave us a little. We
can’t afford to despise it, Tom. I am sure he
likes me, though he is so cross; and I am
not much afraid that this affair will make any
difference in the end. But besides all that, he
is so friendless and alone, rich as he is.—We
will try to keep him, won’t we, Tom dear?’</p>

<p>‘He must be on his good behaviour, then,’
said Tom, only half mollified. ‘I’ll stand no
more nonsense, let him be as rich as Crœsus.’</p>

<p>‘Leave him to me,’ said Lucy; ‘there will
be no more trouble with him. It was my own
fault for giving way so much. I shall be wiser
now, and so will he.’</p>

<p>‘As you like, dear,’ said her husband. ‘I
have no right to oppose you in this matter, if
you are willing to sacrifice yourself. I am very
much afraid you will be disappointed. Forgiveness
of injuries is not in your dear uncle’s nature,
or I am much mistaken. He hates me like
poison now, of course; and he can’t benefit you
without doing the same by me, to some extent.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ returned Lucy thoughtfully.
‘I think you will find him very different in
future. He seems to me as if he had had a
shock. No one has ever stood up to him before,
you know; and the treatment may have a
good effect.’</p>

<p>It did not occur to either of them to attach
any importance to the visits of Mr Blackford,
of whose profession they were ignorant. Uncle
Franklin, though he had retired from trade,
continued his speculative investments; and the
calls of gentlemen of unmistakable ‘business’
appearance were of such common occurrence,
that they had almost ceased to attract notice
in the household, the master and mistress of
which were two of the least curious people in
the world.</p>

<p>The old man certainly was altered, suddenly
and strangely. His ill-temper had disappeared; he
even refrained from swearing when, on one occasion,
a mishap in the kitchen ruined his lunch.
He became remarkably silent; he gave up his
morning walk, seldom read his paper, and moped
all day in his armchair, following Lucy about
the room with his eyes whenever she was present.
She was rather anxious about him, and did her
best, by redoubled kindness and attention, to
soothe what she supposed to be his mortification
under the sharp rebuke which he had received.
For a long time he scarcely noticed her efforts,
remaining sullen and unresponsive; but after
a while she found that he still liked her to
be near him, and got restless and uneasy if
she were long absent. He seemed to have something
on his mind, and would gaze into the
fire and mutter anxiously to himself for hours
together. For Tom he entertained a hearty and
unconcealed aversion, never speaking to him
unless obliged to do so, and glaring at him
with no doubtful expression whenever his back
was turned. Of this Tom was almost oblivious,
and entirely careless; for no ‘expectations,’ however
important to himself or to others, could
have enabled him to dissemble his real feelings
towards any one whom he either loved or disliked.</p>
